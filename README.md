Dedicated Accounts Scraper
==========================

Just showing my work! The code I used to scrape the [Texas Comptroller](http://www.window.state.tx.us/)'s site to collect the data that was later used to build this [interactive](http://www.texastribune.org/library/data/dedicated-revenue-funds-list/).

Installation & Usage
--------------------

Wanna give this a shot? Just run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then run:

    python scrape.py

The data is stored in the same directory in a file called `scrape_results.csv`.
